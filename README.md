### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jude Etuka

I'm Jude Etuka, a passionate software developer and AI researcher with a relentless curiosity for exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what software can achieve. My journey in tech has led me to specialize in both **Software Development** and **AI Research**, where Iâ€™m currently focused on leveraging the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create innovative, intelligent solutions.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Working On

I'm deeply involved in the **implementation of LLMs** across various projects. My current work revolves around harnessing the capabilities of these models to enhance user interactions, streamline processes, and bring a new level of intelligence to software applications. Specifically, I'm working on:

- **LLM Integration:** Bringing the power of natural language processing to different platforms and services.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Learning how to combine LLMs with external knowledge bases to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Fine-tuning LLMs:** Customizing and optimizing LLMs for specific tasks, ensuring they perform efficiently and effectively in real-world applications.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

My continuous learning journey involves diving deeper into:

- **The Workings of LLMs:** Understanding the core architecture, strengths, and limitations of these models to better apply them in various domains.
- **RAG Techniques:** Exploring how LLMs can be augmented with retrieval systems to access external data sources, improving the quality of generated content.
- **Fine-tuning Techniques:** Mastering the art of tailoring LLMs for specific use cases, making them more adaptable and useful in specialized applications.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About

With a strong foundation in software development and AI, Iâ€™m always excited to discuss anything related to these fields. Whether it's about building cross-platform applications, creating robust backend systems, or exploring the latest in AI research, Iâ€™m here to share insights and engage in thought-provoking conversations! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

### ðŸš€ Projects I've Worked On

I've had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in software development and AI integration:

1. **Crypto Currency Software (NDA Protected):**  
   Developed a small-scale cryptocurrency software for Android, where I was responsible for creating a secure, user-friendly platform for managing digital currencies. Due to the nature of this project, details are under NDA, but it highlights my ability to work on sensitive and high-security applications.

2. **Wallet Software (In Progress):**  
   Currently, I'm building a wallet application with innovative features designed for fundraisers and progressive savings. This project aims to empower users with greater financial control and flexibility, combining advanced financial tools with a seamless user experience.

3. **Passwordless E-commerce Website:**  
   I developed a cutting-edge e-commerce platform that eliminates the need for traditional passwords, enhancing security and user convenience. This platform is integrated with a Telegram bot that serves as an additional purchase channel. The bot, powered by an LLM, acts as a middleman translator, facilitating communication between users and the admin. This was an organizational project, and I played the role of the sole developer, managing the entire development process from concept to deployment.

4. **E-commerce Based Social Media Application (In Progress):**  
   I'm currently working on a unique social media platform centered around e-commerce, blending the worlds of online shopping and social interaction. This application is designed to offer users a dynamic and engaging shopping experience, integrated with social features that encourage interaction and community building.

5. **Super-powered E-school Software (In Progress):**  
   This ambitious project is focused on creating a comprehensive virtual schooling system. The platform allows users to establish fully virtual schools, complete with robust class and grading systems. Additionally, users can join existing schools or even host their own classes and courses, providing a flexible and powerful tool for education in the digital age.

### ðŸ’» My Tech Stack & Tools

I bring a diverse set of skills to the table, with expertise in:

- **Cross-Platform Development:** Utilizing **Flutter** and **Kivy/KivyMD** to create applications that run smoothly across multiple platforms.
- **Web Development:** Crafting dynamic and responsive websites using frameworks like **Django**, **Flask**, **ReactJS**, and **NestJS**.
- **Backend Development:** Designing and implementing robust APIs that power modern applications.
- **Containerization & Databases:** Proficient in **Docker** for containerization and **PostgreSQL** for managing complex databases.

### âš¡ Fun Fact

I consider myself an overthinker, but I use this trait to meticulously plan and consider every possible scenario. This approach allows me to make well-informed decisions and tackle challenges with a strategic mindset. In my social life, this means I display little emotion, relying on logic to navigate interactions and predict outcomesâ€”often finding creative ways to prevent issues before they arise.
